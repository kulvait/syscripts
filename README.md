# syscripts

**Utility scripts for processing synchrotron tomography data**  
Developed primarily for use at the P05 and P07 beamlines at Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon.


##  Overview

This repository contains a collection of standalone scripts used in the processing of synchrotron-based microtomography data. These tools support a variety of common tasks such as data preparation, conversion, and automation of processing workflows.

While these scripts are not yet integrated into a unified software package, they are used in real-world processing pipelines and aim to simplify repetitive or manual tasks. They may be particularly useful for users working with tomography data from DESY's PETRA III beamlines (e.g. P05 and P07).


##  Features

- Data preprocessing utilities
- Batch conversion tools
- Workflow automation scripts
- Designed for synchrotron X-ray microtomography data
- Developed in active beamline environments (P05, P07)


##  Use Cases

These scripts were developed during practical work at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon and have been used to support imaging experiments involving:

- X-ray microtomography
- Time-resolved tomography
- High-throughput data collection


##  Structure

Scripts may vary in language (primarily Python and shell) and are organized by functionality or processing stage. Please refer to comments in individual files for usage instructions.
